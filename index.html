              <p class="defbox">Operators in JavaScript are very similar to operators that appear in other programming languages.

            <p class="defbox">Variables can be thought of as named containers. You can place data into these containers and then refer to the data simply by naming the container. Before you use a variable in a JavaScript program, you must declare it. Variables are declared with the var.</p>
